# Sublime-Bypass - Patch-It-Yourself (PIT)

This document will guide you on how to patch any Sublime product (Text or Merge) in under 5 minutes.

<details>
<summary>Pre-requisites</summary>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Sublime Text installed (preferably from the official source (sublimetext.com))</li>
	<li><a href="/hosts.md">This piece of text on your /etc/hosts.</a></li>
	<li>A copy of this Repository, you can just clone it or download it from the Releases section in Github (make sure you click "Source Code")</li>
</details>

Now that you have all of that, lets get into the installation/patching!


First, make sure you're on the directory where you downloaded the repo. Then run this command (this is the patcher itself) and follow the instructions.

```bash
 sudo bash sublime-bypass.sh
```

Now that you have patched your Sublime product, go to Help > Enter License and type whatever you want in there. Or even copy and paste this license!
