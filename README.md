# Sublime-Bypass

# What is this?
Sublime-Bypass is a tool that allows you to deactivate the activation system of any Sublime product by modifying the Hex values of the executable.

# Huh, how do i download and use Sublime-Bypass?
Before you start downloading stuff, I have to tell you that there are two ways to use Sublime-Bypass, one of them is through patching Sublime Text/Merge by yourself (recommended) or downloading one of the pre-patched executables.

To see the Patch-It-Yourself method, click [here](/pit.md)

To download a pre-patched executable, go to the ["Releases"](https://github.com/CITIZENSIXTYNINE/Sublime-Bypass/releases) section on Github.

Oh and, Sublime-Bypass only works on Linux. The script and executables are meant to be used on a Linux system.

Please note that there are **NO** plans to port this to Windows or MacOS (read the Notes below).

# Troubleshooting

1. The script did nothing!
- Try to reboot your computer and re-try to run it. If that didn't work, please open an Issue through Github and explain everything you've done. Also note that Sublime HQ might patch this method at any time, so keep that in mind.

2. My Sublime now says its unregistered after some time!
- Its something that happens often, just go to Help > Enter License and repeat the steps mentioned earlier

# Wait is this even legal?!
Probably not, this tool was made for both educational purposes and as a petition for Sublime HQ to change the prices depending on the country (buying power changes between countries fyi) and to give Students and Hobbyists free or discounted versions. So by using it, you're kind of asking them this and also flipping the middle finger in front of their faces.

Remember, Morals over Legality.

# Notes
There are no plans to port Sublime-Bypass to other operating systems. Mainly due to #LinuxElitism and because I have no way to test those versions, you can make forks and even push some branches if you find a way to port this into those operating systems. And from what I've read, leogx9r (creator/researcher of the method Sublime-Bypass uses) has a working Windows patcher (and apparently there are no plans to release it so... yeah).

Sublime Bypass has been tested with Sublime Text 4126
